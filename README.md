# LA-Metro-Bike-Share-Analysis
My first project during my Data Analysis Camp
From the free online datasets found at: https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/ I created this analysis and presentation to present in front of my instructors and classmates. The data came in a .csv file and was relatively clean however there was still some steps necessary to get everything I needed in order to build certain tables and reach my conclusions.
